He also ensured that the U.S. delegation contained important Congressional Republicans including Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. After the formalities of the negotiations were completed, leaving nothing to chance, Harding spoke in person to the Senate on February 10, 1922 and submitted the treaties for consent. He noted that he was respectful of the Senate’s part in contracting foreign relations, then added “I have come to know the viewpoint and inescapable responsibility of the executive” and then asked for expeditious agreement.\n","The treaties resulted in the only successful limitation and reduction of armament the world had known to that time.\n","Victor Recording # 35718-A (5:18)\n","President Harding speaks at Hoboken, New Jersey at a ceremony honoring 5,212 soldiers, sailors, marines, and nurses who were killed defending our country in the World War.

He also noted the importance of U.S. citizens becoming fully integrated into the “melting pot” of American culture. He cautioned to avoid “hyphenated citizenship,” whereby immigrants’ loyalties were diluted by being divided between America and their country of origin. It was a popular way of speaking about the millions of immigrants who had poured into the United States beginning in the early 1880’s. Until that time most of the growth in the nation’s population had come through the American ”multiplication table,” as people described it—the huge size of American families. The new immigration was centering on Eastern Europe, unlike the older immigrants who came from Western Europe. The resumption of new immigration was much on the minds of political leaders as the United States emerged from World War I.\n","None\n","None\n","In this quintessential campaign speech, Harding lamented the nation’s lost opportunity for world moral leadership after the World War I, and states his intent to regain it.

The first speech, The Republican Party, was given on August 25, 1920. In it, Senator Harding praised the Republicans in Congress for supporting President Wilson in the war effort and affirmed his belief that \"politics should stop at the water's edge.\" In the second speech, A Tribute to Our Disabled Soldiers, given on August 19, 1920, he praised disabled soldiers, including two in the audience from Wyandot County, Ohio, and reminded us of the adage \"all politics is local.\"\n","Pathé Actuelle #021042-B (4:48)\n","Harding praised the American men and women who served in World War I. He also notes that services, sacrifices and injuries should be recognized and deficiencies restored.

The collapse of the Tsarist Empire in March* and subsequent communist victory in the November Revolution* of 1917 was of concern. But it was the Bolshevists’ closure of the democratic Constituent Assembly, the signing of the peace treaty with Germany, the massacre of the Imperial family, attacks on churches, and Red Terror that shocked the western world. The sense of the American people was that democracy was the future of government everywhere; and certainly not the beliefs of the small but vocal group of communists and socialists in the United States. Senator Harding was making that point when he stated that men “must always remember that the rights of freedom impose the obligations which maintain it.”\n","He also speaks of his approval of collective bargaining in labor/management relations but emphasizes the right of every American to seek employment without being forced to accept the conditions of the union shop.\n","In this speech, Senator Harding noted that profiteering is a crime of commission, underproduction a crime of omission and called for labor, management and capital to reach an understanding for the benefit of the nation; and then emphasized the supremacy of the human element. After every American war save World War II there has been a period of boom, then bust—often described by the party in power as recession, depression by its rival. After World War I almost everyone-- people and government-- desired freedom from the restrictions of wartime. The Wilson Administration lagged and soon labor and management were at odds with dispute after dispute and group animosity that the senator from Ohio deplored.\n","Senator Harding argued that a “covenant of conscience” rather than a written compact—which would surrender freedom of action and give a military alliance the right to proclaim America’s duty to the world as in Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations—would be in the best interests of the U.S. The Republican candidate was proposing a separate American peace with the German government, subsequently accomplished by the Treaty of Berlin of 1921. He also hinted of his desire to bring about a reduction of armament and to decrease the possibility of a renewed arms race and the resultant threat to world peace and burden on financial resources, an accomplishment of the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, 1921-22.\n","Although he was officially nominated at the Republican National Convention on June 12, Senator Harding was formally notified of his nomination at his home in Marion, Ohio on July 22, 1920. In his acceptance speech he reaffirms his belief in the Republican Party as the best vehicle for restoring tranquility and stability. Harding pledged to restore “balance” to the relationship between Congress and the presidency, noting that the nation cannot and should not be governed by one man. His allusion to the failure of the Versailles Treaty in Congress reinforced this message. Party government, he believed, is essential to the health of the republic.\n"," Harding accepts the Republican nomination for President.\n","Nation's Forum (NF 21) 4985 (4:48)\n","The basis for this recording was an address entitled “Back to Normal” Senator Harding delivered to the Home Market Club of Boston on May 14, 1920. He reminded citizens that all human ills are not curable by legislation (a gentle chiding of the Democrats), and stated that “if we can prove a representative popular government under which the citizenship seeks what it may do for the government and country, rather than what the country may do for individuals, we shall do more to make democracy safe for the world than all armed conflict ever recorded.” The listener can catch the extraordinary ability of the senator with words and the quickness and imagination with which he could speak. The speech is also notable for Harding’s phrase “not heroics, but healing, not nostrums, but normalcy.” Critics of the senator would claim that he coined the word “normalcy,” which actually goes back to Elizabethan times.\n","Pathé Actuelle Recording # 021042 A (5:03)\n","Address Delivered before the Ohio Society of New York, Waldorf Hotel, New York City\n","The debate over whether the Senate should agree to the Treaty of Versailles with its provision for entry into the League of Nations continued through the fall of 1919 and early months of 1920.

The speech was originally delivered to the U.S. Senate on April 4, 1917. He emphasized that he was not voting for war in the name of democracy, but to maintain American rights and guarantee neutrality, the very preservation of the nation. The unified effort of the American people and government allowed the largely unprepared United States of America to centralize and harness its powerful economy. Within months, ammunition, weapons, and newly-trained recruits were pouring from America's towns and cities onto transport ships and cargo vessels bound for the European war theater.
