# Trump and other Presidents: Speech Analysis

Part of a Group Project for the Unstructured Data Analytics course in UT Austin's MS Business Analytics program

## Problem Statement:

We recently completed a project that aimed to identify the differences in former President Trump's speeches compared to other presidents. The objective was to understand how he was distinct from other presidents in terms of his language and messaging. To achieve this, we utilized the Presidential Speech Archive as our dataset.

The project consisted of several steps, including:

1. Performing a SpaCy NLP similarity analysis using large pre-trained word vectors to compare former president Trumpâ€™s speeches with speeches from all other presidents

2. Performing Lift Analysis of recent Presidents to compare with Trump for common talking points used like gas, immigration, election, crime, glory

3. Polarity and Subjectivity analysis of speeches to validate whether Trump is actually an outlier compared to other presidents

4. Performing topic modelling using LDA to check whether the usual topics of speeches for recent presidents are different to those of Trump

Through this project, we were able to identify unique characteristics and patterns in former President Trump's speeches compared to other presidents. This analysis can be useful for researchers, political scientists and anyone who is interested in understanding how presidential speeches have changed over time

## Insights:

The project aimed to identify differences in former President Trump's speeches compared to other presidents, using the Presidential Speech Archive dataset. Through a combination of NLP techniques and statistical analysis, the following insights and conclusions were drawn:

1. Similarity Analysis: The analysis revealed that modern speeches tend to be more alike, while older speeches are more alike. When comparing Trump's speeches to those of his 3 predecessors and the current president, it was found that Trump talks about the same topics as his peers. However, there is little to no difference across party lines with regard to speech similarity, rather the factor that determines speech similarity the most are the topics or issues of the time.

2. Lift Matrix: The analysis showed that Trump's speeches have a lot of information on specific, opinionated topics compared to his peers.

3. Polarity vs. Subjectivity Plot: The analysis revealed that modern presidents tend to be centered for polarity vs. subjectivity. However, Trump is an outlier in both polarity and subjectivity.

4. Topic Modelling: The analysis found that the past 5 former presidents' topics of speeches included war, taxes and economy, crime, and space. In contrast, Trump's speeches were found to focus on nationalist, COVID-19, immigration, and terrorism
